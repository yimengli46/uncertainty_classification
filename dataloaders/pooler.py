            aligned (bool): if False, use the legacy implementation in
                Detectron. If True, align the results more perfectly.

        Note:
            The meaning of aligned=True:

            Given a continuous coordinate c, its two neighboring pixel indices (in our
            pixel model) are computed by floor(c - 0.5) and ceil(c - 0.5). For example,
            c=1.3 has pixel neighbors with discrete indices [0] and [1] (which are sampled
            from the underlying signal at continuous coordinates 0.5 and 1.5). But the original
            roi_align (aligned=False) does not subtract the 0.5 when computing neighboring
            pixel indices and therefore it uses pixels with a slightly incorrect alignment
            (relative to our pixel model) when performing bilinear interpolation.

            With `aligned=True`,
            we first appropriately scale the ROI and then shift it by -0.5
            prior to calling roi_align. This produces the correct neighbors; see
            detectron2/tests/test_roi_align.py for verification.

            The difference does not make a difference to the model's performance if
            ROIAlign is used together with conv layers.

            scales (list[float]): The scale for each low-level pooling op relative to

                image, scale is defined as a 1 / s. The stride must be power of 2.

                should be placed. The default is defined as level 4 (stride=16) in the FPN paper,
                i.e., a box of size 224x224 will be placed on the feature with stride=16.
                The box placement for all boxes will be determined from their sizes w.r.t
                canonical_box_size. For example, a box whose area is 4x that of a canonical box
                should be used to pool features from feature level ``canonical_level+1``.
